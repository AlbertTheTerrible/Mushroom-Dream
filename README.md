Another tileset for the game Cataclysm:Dark Days Ahead.

I started this tileset to contribute to the CDDA project and develop myself as an artist. The two main focuses for this is readability and scale, so that, hopefully, the world feels more immersive for the player.

This is still in it's early phase and a WIP, but give it a look if you'd like.
