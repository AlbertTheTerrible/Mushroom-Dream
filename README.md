Hey guys, i'm Albert and i'm drawing up a tilest for Cataclysm:DDA

Why? I'm an artist and i always found it interesting that my work would lead people on stories and adventure, and CDDA is the perfect game for that. 

If you want, share your adventure on the cdda subreddit [/r/cataclysmdda](https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/)
